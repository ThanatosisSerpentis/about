# Thanatosis Serpentis

We founded us to to read, review and learn code. We formed us after the inspiring talk [Lets review code together](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) by [khaleesicodes](https://github.com/khaleesicodes) and [stoeckmann](https://github.com/stoeckmann).

We usually meet on Thursday 20:00 CE(S)T in our Jitsi room.

In the group are both experts and beginners and everbody is welcome. Our goals are to learn more about Python, review programs and find bugs.

You are interested, have questions or want join us? Lets talk in our [discussions](https://github.com/ThanatosisSerpentis/about/discussions)!
